# Dog Adoption Portal
This project is an Angular-based admin dashboard for managing dog records in a dog adoption portal. It allows admins to add, edit, and delete dog profiles, and manage the availability status for adoption. This frontend application interacts with a backend REST API, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ManThisSucks/ITS181-2-Proj-Backend).

This project was created to fulfill the course requirements for ITS181-2_FOPI01 at Mapua University.
